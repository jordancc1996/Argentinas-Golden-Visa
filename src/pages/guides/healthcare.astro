          Argentina’s Healthcare System
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Argentina has a mixed healthcare system: public hospitals and clinics, employer-linked schemes (obras sociales), and private prepaid plans (prepagas). For expats and visa holders, understanding the difference between these options—and what is required for entry and residency—helps you plan. This guide covers public vs. private care, leading private plans for expats, hospital quality in major cities, costs compared to the US and EU, prescription medications, dental care, emergency services, and health insurance requirements for visa holders. Rules and access have changed in recent years; confirm current requirements with your consulate or Migraciones before travel or application.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
          Argentina’s healthcare is often cited as among the strongest in Latin America. Private facilities in the main cities are used to serving foreign residents and can offer a standard of care and convenience that many expats find adequate for routine and most specialist needs. Public care fills gaps and remains important for emergencies and for those without private coverage.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Public healthcare</strong> is funded by the state and has historically provided free care to residents. As of 2025, non-emergency care for temporary residents may require proof of health insurance or upfront payment in some settings; emergency care remains available to everyone. Public facilities are uneven: wait times for non-urgent care can be long, and quality and equipment vary by hospital and region.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Obras sociales</strong> are social health schemes tied to employment and run by trade unions. They cover a large share of the population. Contributions are typically around 3% from the employee and 6% from the employer. Access is usually for people in formal employment with resident status; expats on investor, rentista, or pensionado visas typically do not join an obra social unless they become employed locally. As of 2025, employees with prepaid coverage may direct the full compulsory healthcare contribution to their private prepaga instead of an obra social.

              Prepagas (Private Health Plans)
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Prepagas</strong> are private health plans with a monthly fee. You use a network of affiliated clinics and hospitals; care is typically arranged without large upfront payments at the point of service. Coverage usually includes consultations, specialists, diagnostics, and emergency care; many plans offer discounted prescriptions and dental add-ons.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Prepagas are the usual choice for expats who are not in the obra social system. Enrollment generally requires a valid visa or residency and sometimes a DNI. Plans are tiered by network breadth and level of coverage; premiums vary by age, plan, and provider. International health insurance that includes Argentina is an alternative for those who split time between countries or want coverage before securing local residency.

            Top Private Health Plans for Expats
          </h2>
          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">OSDE</strong> and <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Swiss Medical</strong> are the two prepagas most commonly used by expats in Argentina. Both have broad networks in Buenos Aires and in many other cities, multiple plan levels, and clinics and hospitals used to dealing with foreign residents. <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Medicus</strong> and <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Medifé</strong> are also well-known options with strong networks. Other prepagas (e.g. Galeno, Omint) offer additional choices; compare coverage, networks, and premiums before enrolling.
          </p>
          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
            Premiums depend on age, plan tier, and whether you add dependents. As a rough reference, basic private coverage for an individual can be in the range of roughly USD 100–200 or more per month in peso equivalent; top-tier plans cost more. Prices are set in pesos and can change with inflation and regulation. Confirm current rates and eligibility (e.g. residency status) directly with the prepaga or a local broker.

              <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Buenos Aires</strong> has the country’s densest concentration of private hospitals and clinics. Institutions such as Hospital Italiano, Hospital Alemán, and facilities in the Swiss Medical and OSDE networks offer modern equipment and many physicians who have trained abroad; English-speaking staff are more common here than in smaller cities. Public hospitals in the capital provide emergency and routine care but often with longer waits.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Mendoza</strong> and <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Bariloche</strong> have solid private and public infrastructure for a city of their size. Major prepagas have affiliated providers in both; Mendoza has several well-regarded private clinics and Bariloche has hospitals and clinics that serve residents and tourists. Quality is generally good for routine and urgent care; for highly specialized procedures, some expats still travel to Buenos Aires. Northern and more remote areas tend to have fewer resources and longer distances to referral centres.

              Costs Compared to the US and EU
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Healthcare in Argentina is generally <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">less expensive</strong> than in the United States. Hospital and procedure costs are often a fraction of US levels; doctor visits in the private sector can be in the range of roughly USD 20–50 or more per consultation in peso equivalent. Private insurance premiums are typically lower than in the US for comparable coverage.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Compared to Western Europe, Argentina is also usually cheaper, though some Central European countries have similar or lower costs. Public care in Argentina is free or low-cost for those who qualify; the main trade-off is wait times and variable quality. Out-of-pocket dental and prescription costs are often lower than in North America and many European countries. All figures depend on exchange rates and local inflation; check current prices when budgeting.

Bring a copy of your prescription or a doctor’s note when buying; some drugs may have different brand names or availability.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Private dental care is available in all major cities; costs are typically lower than in North America. In Buenos Aires, many dentists speak English and work with expats and tourists; emergency and routine care (fillings, crowns, cleanings) are easy to arrange. Some prepagas include dental coverage or sell it as an add-on. Public dental services exist but are more limited. For complex or elective work, compare clinics and confirm that materials and standards meet your expectations.

For other emergencies, <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">911</strong> is the general number. Emergency care is provided regardless of insurance status; public hospitals treat emergencies without requiring proof of coverage. Private hospitals may request insurance details or payment for non-emergency follow-up. If you have a prepaga, use their emergency line or network when possible to simplify billing.

            As of 2025, <strong class="text-white font-normal">all foreign visitors</strong> entering Argentina—including tourists, temporary workers, and students—must present <strong class="text-white font-normal">valid health insurance or medical assistance coverage</strong> for the entire stay. Airlines may verify coverage at check-in. The rule applies regardless of whether you enter by air, land, or sea. Emergency care remains available to everyone, but non-emergency use of public facilities may require proof of insurance or payment.
          </p>
          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For <strong class="text-white font-normal">residency applications</strong> (investor, rentista, pensionado, and other temporary residency visas), Migraciones and consulates typically require proof of health insurance valid in Argentina. That can be a local prepaga, an international plan that covers Argentina, or both, depending on what the office accepts. Confirm the exact requirement with the consulate or Migraciones before you apply, and ensure your policy meets the minimum duration and geographic coverage they specify.
          </p>
          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
            If you are already in Argentina on a visa and later enroll in a prepaga, you will need a valid visa or residency and often a DNI. Plan to arrange insurance before travel if you are a first-time visitor, and before your residency appointment if you are applying for a visa.
