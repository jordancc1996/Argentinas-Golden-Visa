          Banking and Finances in Argentina

        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Opening a bank account and managing money in Argentina as a foreigner involves specific requirements, a choice of banks and account types, and an understanding of exchange rates and transfer options. This guide covers what you need to open an account as a non-citizen, which banks work well for expats, USD accounts, crypto regulations, money transfer services (including Wise and Western Union), the difference between the blue dollar and the official rate, credit cards, and practical tips. Rules and bank policies change; confirm current requirements with the bank or the Central Bank (BCRA) before you apply.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
          Since 2025, the removal of most currency controls has made it easier to hold and move USD, use international transfers, and obtain a realistic exchange rate through official channels. Having a local account and a CUIL also simplifies paying rent, utilities, and prepaga health insurance in pesos.

              Requirements for Opening a Bank Account as a Foreigner
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The Central Bank (BCRA) allows foreigners to open accounts. You do not always need a DNI: with a <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">precaria</strong> (temporary residence permit) and supporting documents, many institutions can open a “cuenta para migrantes” (immigrant savings account). Typical requirements include a valid <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">passport</strong>, <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">CUIL</strong> (Unique Code for Labor Identification, obtainable with your precaria), <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">proof of address</strong> in Argentina, and your <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">visa or residency document</strong>. Some banks also ask for proof of income. Public banks are required to offer these accounts under BCRA rules; they can be free if monthly cash movements and balance stay within set limits (e.g. under a certain peso amount).
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Private banks often insist on a DNI and may refuse applicants who only have a precaria. If you meet the BCRA criteria and a bank still denies you, you can file a complaint with the Central Bank. Requirements can differ by branch; trying another branch or a different bank is common. Having a CUIL and proof of address ready speeds things up.

              <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Public banks</strong> are usually the most accessible for foreigners without a DNI: <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Banco de la Nación Argentina</strong> and <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Banco Provincia</strong> have broad networks and are used to opening accounts with a precaria. <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">ICBC</strong> (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China) has also opened accounts for foreigners with temporary residency. Digital banks such as <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Brubank</strong> sometimes accept applicants with less documentation; check current eligibility.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Once you have a DNI, private options expand: <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Banco Galicia</strong> (which acquired HSBC’s Argentine operations in 2024), <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Santander</strong>, <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">BBVA</strong>, <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Banco Patagonia</strong>, and <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Banco Supervielle</strong> offer full retail and sometimes international services. Compare fees, branch and ATM availability, and online banking before choosing.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Many banks offer <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">caja de ahorro</strong> (savings accounts) in pesos and in foreign currency, including US dollars. A USD account lets you hold and sometimes receive dollars without converting to pesos. As of 2025, Argentina has eased most currency controls; buying and selling foreign exchange through the banking system is simpler, and wire transfers (e.g. up to certain amounts) are less restricted than in previous years.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Eligibility for USD accounts depends on the bank and your status (residency, DNI, income proof). Some banks require a DNI; others may allow USD accounts with a precaria. Confirm with your branch. Keeping part of your funds in USD can help with inflation and devaluation risk, though regulations and availability can change.

              Blue Dollar vs Official Rate
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">official rate</strong> is the exchange rate set or influenced by the Central Bank and used by banks and authorized exchange houses. The <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">blue dollar</strong> (dólar blue) is the unofficial, parallel market rate for cash USD, typically traded at informal exchange houses (cuevas) or with street changers (arbolitos). For years, capital controls limited how much people could buy at the official rate, so the blue dollar traded at a large premium (often 50–100% more pesos per dollar).
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              In 2025, most of those controls were lifted and the peso was allowed to move within a band. The gap between the blue and official rates has narrowed sharply (e.g. to around 2–3% in some periods). The blue dollar is less relevant than before; using the official or bank rate is now much closer to the parallel market. Rely on official or bank channels unless you have a specific reason to use the informal market, and be aware that informal exchange carries legal and safety risks.

              <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Wise</strong> (formerly TransferWise) and <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Western Union</strong> operate in Argentina and allow you to send or receive money from abroad. Wise typically uses the mid-market rate and charges a fee; you can send to an Argentine bank account or sometimes to a local partner for cash pickup. Western Union has a large agent network for cash pickup and can be useful for recipients without a bank account.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              International wire transfers to your Argentine bank account are possible and have become simpler with the easing of currency controls. Limits and documentation (e.g. for larger amounts) may still apply. <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Mercado Pago</strong> is the dominant local digital wallet and payment method but usually requires a local bank account or identity verification. Compare fees, exchange rates, and delivery options before choosing a service.

              Crypto Regulations
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Argentina has introduced clearer regulation of crypto assets. The <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">National Securities Commission (CNV)</strong> oversees licensing of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). The <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF)</strong> monitors anti-money-laundering compliance, and <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">AFIP</strong> (the tax authority) treats crypto gains as taxable in many cases. Law 27.739 and CNV resolutions set registration and compliance deadlines for businesses offering virtual asset services.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              A voluntary disclosure regime has allowed taxpayers to declare crypto holdings at reduced tax rates by a set deadline. If you hold or trade crypto as a resident, assume it can be taxed and that exchanges and service providers may be subject to KYC and reporting rules. Confirm current rules with a local tax or crypto specialist before making decisions.

              Getting a <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">local</strong> credit card usually requires a DNI, a bank account, and sometimes proof of income. Banks such as Galicia, Santander, BBVA, and Nación offer peso and sometimes USD-linked cards. Installment payments (cuotas) are common for local cardholders.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Foreign-issued</strong> Visa and Mastercard credit and debit cards are widely accepted in Argentina. Foreign cards have received a preferential “tourist” (MEP) exchange rate at the point of sale that is better than the old official rate; with the 2025 liberalization, the gap between rates has narrowed. Using a foreign card for day-to-day spending can be convenient until you have a local account and card.
