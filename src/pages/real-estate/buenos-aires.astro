          Investing in Buenos Aires Property
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Buenos Aires is a core market for real estate investors and expats considering Argentina. The city offers a range of neighborhoods, from high-end Puerto Madero and Recoleta to more affordable San Telmo and emerging areas such as Villa Crespo and Chacarita. This guide covers top neighborhoods for investors, average property prices per square metre, rental yields, the legal process for foreigners buying property, emerging neighborhoods, lifestyle highlights by area, and a brief investment outlook. Prices and yields change with the market and exchange rate; confirm current figures with local agents or advisors before deciding.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
          Foreign buyers can purchase without residency; transactions are usually in USD and follow a clear notary and registration process. Choosing the right barrio and property type—and budgeting for closing costs and ongoing management—is essential for both yield-focused and lifestyle-focused investments.

          The city-wide average asking price in Buenos Aires has been in the range of roughly <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">USD 2,400–2,500 per m²</strong> in recent data; premium areas trade well above that. Below is a snapshot of four key investment neighborhoods with indicative prices per m², typical gross rental yields, and lifestyle context. Yields are gross (before management, maintenance, and vacancy); net yields often sit around 3.5–4% after those costs.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Gross rental yields in Buenos Aires vary by neighborhood and property type. City-wide averages have been cited in the range of <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">roughly 5–7% gross</strong> for apartments, with smaller units (e.g. studios) often yielding more (e.g. around 6–8%) and larger or premium units somewhat less. Premium areas such as Puerto Madero and Recoleta often show <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">4–5% gross</strong> yields; mid-range and character areas (e.g. San Telmo, Villa Crespo) can reach the higher end of the range.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              After property management (often 8–10% of rent), maintenance, and vacancy, <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">net yields</strong> commonly fall to about <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">3.5–4%</strong>. Rental law changes in recent years have affected supply and demand; confirm current market conditions and local regulations with a property manager or lawyer before projecting returns.

              Legal Process for Foreigners Buying Property
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Foreigners have the same property rights as Argentine citizens under the Constitution. You do not need residency or a work visa to buy; a tourist visa is sufficient. Purchases are typically made in <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">US dollars</strong>, and funds should enter through authorized banking channels (Central Bank–compliant transfers); avoid large cash payments.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Steps: (1) <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Obtain a CDI</strong> (tax ID) from AFIP using your passport and proof of address in Argentina; this can be done remotely with a local representative. (2) <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Hire a local lawyer</strong> to handle due diligence, taxes, and compliance. (3) Work with a <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">notary (escribano)</strong> who drafts the deed, runs title searches, and oversees the transfer. (4) Sign the <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">escritura pública</strong> (notarized deed). (5) <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">Register</strong> the deed at the Property Registry (Registro de la Propiedad Inmueble). The process often takes <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">4–6 weeks</strong>. Closing costs are typically <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">6–9%</strong> of the purchase price (stamp tax, notary, registration); primary residence buyers may qualify for stamp tax relief. Rural and certain border-zone land remain restricted for foreigners under current law.

          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Buenos Aires residential market has been in a recovery phase after a long period of price pressure. Transaction volumes have risen sharply in recent years (e.g. year-over-year increases in the range of 40% or more in some periods), and average prices in USD terms have shown modest appreciation (e.g. around 5–6% annually in recent data). Properties often sell at a small discount to asking (e.g. 93–95% of list), with time on market varying by zone and type (often 90–150 days).
          </p>
          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Factors that can support demand include the easing of currency controls (improving access to dollars and financing), visa and residency options for investors and retirees, and the city’s appeal to digital nomads and expats. Risks include inflation, exchange-rate volatility, and changes in rental or tax regulation. Diversifying by neighborhood and budgeting for management and costs helps; always obtain local legal and tax advice before buying.
