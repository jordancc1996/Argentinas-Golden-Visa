          Residency for Retirees
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Argentina’s Retirement Visa (Visa Pensionado or Permiso de Ingreso Temporario como Pensionado) is a temporary residency permit for people who receive a pension from a government or an international organization. It is administered by the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones and allows you to live in Argentina while drawing your pension abroad. After the required period of temporary residency, you can apply for permanent residency and, later, citizenship.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Pensionado visa is intended for retirees who can prove a stable, ongoing pension that meets the minimum income set by Migraciones. The pension must be from a state or international body (e.g. social security, government retirement, or an international organization’s pension scheme). Private savings, rental income, or investment returns alone do not qualify for this category; those may be relevant for the Rentista (passive income) visa instead. You must also meet character and documentation requirements, including apostilled and translated documents where required.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Applications can be started from abroad at an Argentine consulate or in Argentina after entry, using the online RaDEX system to upload documents and request an appointment with Migraciones. Processing times and exact document lists can differ slightly between consular and in-country procedures; confirm the current steps with the office that will handle your case.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
          This guide covers who qualifies, minimum pension and income requirements, required documents and their legalization, the step-by-step process, the typical timeline from application to approval, healthcare considerations for retirees, and answers to common questions. Rules and amounts can change; confirm current requirements with Migraciones or a qualified immigration lawyer before applying.

              Who Qualifies
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The Pensionado visa is for people who receive a pension from a government or an international organization. The source of the pension is strict: social security, civil service or military retirement, or a pension paid by an international body (e.g. UN, World Bank) typically qualify. Pensions from private employers or from personal investments do not, by themselves, meet the Pensionado requirement; applicants in that situation may need to consider the Rentista visa.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You must be of legal age and able to prove that the pension is ongoing and meets the minimum amount. You must have a clean criminal record in your country of residence and, when applicable, in Argentina. Health insurance valid in Argentina is generally required for temporary residency. Migraciones may also require proof of address in Argentina if you apply in-country.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Migraciones sets the minimum pension in Argentine pesos. The requirement is typically at least <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">ARS 30,000 per month</strong>, or the equivalent of approximately five times the Argentine minimum wage, whichever applies under current regulations. The peso amount may be updated; always confirm the current figure with Migraciones or your Argentine consulate before applying.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The equivalent in US dollars depends on the exchange rate. In recent years, ARS 30,000 per month has often corresponded to roughly <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">USD 1,400–2,000 per month</strong>, but rates vary. Use the official peso figure as the legal reference and confirm the USD equivalent at the time of your application.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              You must prove the pension with an official letter or certificate from the paying body and with bank statements or payment receipts showing regular deposits. If you have dependents included in the application, Migraciones may require a higher total income; ask the consulate or Migraciones for current rules.

          Total time from starting documents to approval is often 3–6 months. If you apply in Argentina, you normally enter as a tourist (or with a visa if required for your nationality), then start the process through the RaDEX system (Módulos de Radiación a Distancia de Extranjeros) on the Ministry of Interior website. Request an appointment and pay the fee as instructed. Submitting a complete file reduces delays.
