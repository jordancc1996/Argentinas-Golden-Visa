          Residency Through Investment
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Argentina’s Investor Visa (Visa de Inversionista or Permiso de Ingreso Temporario como Inversionista) is a temporary residency permit for people who make a qualifying investment in productive, commercial, or service activities in Argentina. It is administered by the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones and is one of several pathways to legal residence that can later lead to permanent residency and citizenship.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The visa is intended for active investors: you are expected to manage or oversee the activity in which you invest. Passive holdings or donations alone do not qualify. The investment must be documented and traceable, and you must be able to show that the funds have a legal origin. Once temporary residency is granted, you can renew it, apply for permanent residency after the required period (typically three years), and, if you meet the residence and other conditions, apply for Argentine citizenship after two years of residency.

              Who Can Apply
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Applicants must be of legal age and intend to invest in an activity considered of interest to Argentina. You must prove the legal origin of the funds and that the investment meets the minimum amount and type required by current regulations. There is no nationality restriction; non-MERCOSUR nationals pay a higher migration fee than MERCOSUR and associated states.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Migraciones may request evidence that the investment is real and will be carried out: contracts, incorporation documents, project descriptions, or proof of capital already deployed. Health insurance valid in Argentina is often required for temporary residency; confirm with the consulate or Migraciones. Applicants who have spent significant time in Argentina may need a local criminal record certificate in addition to that from their country of residence.

              The minimum investment is set in Argentine law in local currency. Migraciones requires a minimum of <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">ARS 1,500,000</strong> (one million five hundred thousand Argentine pesos) in a productive, commercial, or service activity. The equivalent in US dollars varies with the exchange rate; at typical rates in recent years the amount has often been in the range of approximately <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">USD 1,500–6,000</strong>, but you must confirm the current USD equivalent at the time of application.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Some government-backed or sector-specific programs (e.g. under decrees such as 366/2025) may set higher minimums in USD for certain projects (e.g. real estate development, tech, or agro-industry). If you are considering such a route, verify the exact amount and conditions with the implementing authority or your advisor.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              The peso amount (ARS 1,500,000) is the legal reference; the USD range given here is indicative. Exchange rates in Argentina can move sharply, so obtain a current conversion or confirmation from a bank, Migraciones, or your lawyer before locking in your investment plan.

          Total time from preparation to approval is often 4–6 months. Request appointment slots by email at tramitacion.ingresos@migraciones.gob.ar when applying at Migraciones headquarters. If you apply from abroad, the consulate will set the procedure (document submission, interview, and collection of the visa). In all cases, submit a complete file; incomplete applications lead to requests for additional information and longer processing.

            Documents must be apostilled or legalized where required and, when not in Spanish, translated by a certified translator. Requirements can vary by consulate or office; use this list as a base and confirm with Migraciones or your lawyer. Criminal records are usually valid for a limited period (e.g. three to six months from issue); time your application so they do not expire before submission. Keep copies of everything you submit and note the date and place of filing for your records.

              Processing Fees
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Migration fees are set in UMSM (Unidad de Medida Salarial Mínima), a unit tied to the minimum wage. For temporary residency as an investor, non-MERCOSUR applicants typically pay <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">100 UMSM</strong>; MERCOSUR and associated states pay a lower rate (e.g. 50 UMSM). The amount in pesos changes when the UMSM value is updated. Check the current tariff at the official Migraciones site (Cuadro de Tasas Migratorias, Decreto 584/2024 and any later updates).
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Budget separately for apostilles, certified translations, notary fees, and any legal or advisory fees. Consulates may charge their own processing or authentication fees; ask when you request the application packet.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Visa validity and renewal terms are set by Migraciones. Initial temporary residency is often granted for one year and can be renewed for longer periods (e.g. three years). After the required years of temporary residency, you may apply for permanent residency; citizenship requires two years of residency plus Spanish and other requirements. Plan your timeline and travel so that you comply with any minimum stay or tax-residency rules that apply to your situation.
