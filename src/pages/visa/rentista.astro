          Residency Based on Passive Income
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Argentina’s Rentista Visa (Visa Rentista or Permiso de Ingreso Temporario como Rentista) is a temporary residency permit for people who can prove a stable passive income from sources such as rentals, investments, or dividends—rather than from employment or an active business in Argentina. It is administered by the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones and allows you to live in Argentina without working locally, using income earned abroad or from passive assets.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Rentista category is distinct from the Pensionado (retirement) visa, which requires a pension from a government or international organization, and from the Inversionista (investor) visa, which requires an active investment in a productive activity in Argentina. If your income comes from real estate rentals, securities, or other passive holdings and you do not need to run a business in Argentina, the Rentista visa may be the appropriate option. You must meet the minimum income threshold, document the source and regularity of that income, and comply with apostille and translation requirements for your documents.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Applications can be started from abroad at an Argentine consulate or in Argentina after entry, using the RaDEX system to upload documents and request an appointment with Migraciones. Processing times and document lists can differ slightly between consular and in-country procedures; confirm the current steps with the office that will handle your case.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
          This guide covers income thresholds, proof-of-income documentation, eligible income sources, application steps, the renewal process, the path to permanent residency, a comparison with the investor visa, and answers to common questions. Rules and amounts can change; confirm current requirements with Migraciones or a qualified immigration lawyer before applying.

              Income Thresholds
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Migraciones sets the minimum passive income in Argentine pesos, often expressed as a multiple of the minimum wage (e.g. five times the minimum wage). In recent years the requirement has frequently been cited as approximately <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">USD 1,500–2,000 per month</strong> per applicant, or the peso equivalent (e.g. ARS 36,000–40,000 or more per month, depending on the year and the official minimum wage). The exact figure is updated periodically; confirm the current amount with Migraciones or your Argentine consulate.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Income must be regular and verifiable. If you include dependents (e.g. spouse, children under a certain age), Migraciones may require a higher total income. Some offices also require you to transfer the equivalent of two or three months of income to an Argentine bank regulated by the Central Bank (BCRA); confirm whether this applies to your case.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The initial Rentista residency is usually granted for <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">one year</strong>. Before it expires, you must apply for renewal through Migraciones (or the consulate if you are abroad). You will need to prove again that you still receive the required passive income, typically with updated bank statements, rental contracts, or investment statements, and that you meet character and other requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Renewals are often granted for a second and third year. Start the renewal process well before your current residency expires; late applications can create gaps in status. Documents may need to be recent (e.g. within the last few months); confirm with Migraciones.

            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              After the required period of <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">temporary residency</strong> (typically three years of valid Rentista status, subject to current rules), you may apply for <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">permanent residency</strong>. Migraciones will confirm that you have complied with the terms of your temporary residency and that you still meet the conditions for residence.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
              Once you hold permanent residency, you can maintain it without renewing on the same one-year cycle. After <strong class="text-charcoal font-normal">two years of permanent residency</strong>, you may become eligible to apply for Argentine citizenship, subject to language proficiency and other requirements. The Rentista route therefore leads to permanent residency and then citizenship without requiring an active investment in Argentina.
